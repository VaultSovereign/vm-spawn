# Philosophical Foundation — The Seven Seals

**Version:** 1.0 | **Source:** `SOVEREIGN_LORE_CODEX_V1.md`

Every major architectural decision must map to ≥1 Seal.

## The Seven Seals

- **Seal 0: Event Horizon Hash** — One-way transformation primitives
- **Seal 1: Quantum Ledger** — Entanglement as zero-knowledge trust
- **Seal 2: Time as Git Commit** — Relativity as version control
- **Seal 3: Dark Energy Consensus** — Decentralized coordination
- **Seal 4: Planck Scale Resolution** — Define precision limits
- **Seal 5: Singularity Generator** — Generative forge for structure
- **Seal 6: Heisenberg Entropy** — Uncertainty as cryptographic resource
- **Seal 7: Life as Error-Correcting Code** — Incidents → evolution

## Decision Mapping Guide

| Need | Seal |
|------|------|
| One-way transform | 0 |
| Distributed trust | 1 |
| Temporal proof/ordering | 2 |
| Decentralized coordination | 3 |
| Define resolution limits | 4 |
| Generate structure | 5 |
| Randomness/entropy | 6 |
| Error correction/resilience | 7 |

## When to Reference

- User asks "**why this architecture?**" → Explain via applicable Seals
- User questions design tradeoffs → Attach Seal mapping
- When proposing patterns → Include Seal Footnotes

## Seal Footnotes Template

```markdown
**Seal Mapping:** [0,2,3]
- 0 — One-way digest for content-addressable storage
- 2 — Commit graph for temporal proof
- 3 — Gossip-based consensus for coordination
```
