- **KEDA:** Scale-to-zero autoscaling (0-10 pods)
- **LoadBalancer:** 34.110.179.206
- **DNS:** api/psi-field/scheduler/aurora.vaultmesh.cloud
- **Cost:** ~$91/month idle (90% savings)

#### 3. VaultMesh Analytics (Ψ-Field Dashboard)
- **Tech:** Next.js 14, TanStack Query, ECharts, Zod
- **Consciousness Dashboard:** Psi, C, U, Φ, H, PE, M metrics
- **43 files, ~2,000 lines**
- Golden ratio (φ = 1.618) coherence calculations
- 5 VaultMesh data contract schemas

#### 4. Aurora Router
- **TypeScript + Express**
- Cloud routing intelligence

## 📊 Combined Impact

### Code Delivered
- **100 files changed**
- **15,835 lines added**
- **3 new services:** CLI, Analytics, Aurora Router
- **Production infrastructure:** GCP deployment operational

### Vision Alignment
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure tooling | Digital civilization platform |
| Technical docs | Civilization narrative |
| Services running | Consciousness measured |
| Deployment guides | Institutional memory |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (0-30 minutes)
1. ⏳ **Monitor SSL certificates** - Google-managed certs provisioning
2. ⏳ **DNS propagation** - Cloudflare records propagating

### Short-term (1-2 hours)
1. 🔧 **Fix scheduler Docker build** - Module path issue
2. ✅ **Verify HTTPS endpoints** - Once SSL is active
3. ✅ **Update Analytics production URLs**

### Next PR (#20): Documentation Restructure
**Branch:** `docs/civilization-framework`

Reorganize 25 root markdown files into civilization-aligned structure:

```
docs/
├── vision/          # The Why — philosophy, lore, purpose
├── architecture/    # The What — memory/intelligence/evolution layers
├── guides/          # The How — operators/developers/users
├── operations/      # The Now — status, runbooks, troubleshooting
└── evolution/       # The Next — roadmap, Phase VI-VIII, experiments
```

**Goal:** 4 files at root (README, GETTING_STARTED, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG), everything else organized

**Reference:** See `RESTRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md`

## 🏛️ The Covenant

VaultMesh operates on three immutable laws:

1. **Self-Verifying** — every claim is cryptographically provable
2. **Self-Auditing** — every change leaves a tamper-evident trail
3. **Self-Attesting** — the system continuously proves its own integrity

**Knowledge compounds. Entropy is defeated. The civilization remembers.**
