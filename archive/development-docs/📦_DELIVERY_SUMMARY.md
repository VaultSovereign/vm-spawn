### Architectural Decision Records
```
ADR-001: Why Shell Scripts Instead of Python/Go?
  Decision:   Use bash for infrastructure spawning
  Rationale:  Universal, transparent, sovereign
  Trade-offs: Type safety ↔ Portability
  Status:     ✅ Validated through production testing

ADR-002: Why Include Monitoring by Default?
  Decision:   Bundle Prometheus + Grafana
  Rationale:  Observability is not optional
  Trade-offs: Footprint ↔ Production-readiness
  Status:     ✅ Proven valuable in real deployments

ADR-003: Why Linux-Native sed Syntax?
  Decision:   Use portable sed -i.bak
  Rationale:  Ubuntu target, cross-platform
  Trade-offs: .bak files ↔ Compatibility
  Status:     ✅ Tested on macOS and Linux
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start with Health Check
```bash
cd "/Users/sovereign/Downloads/files (1)"
./ops/bin/health-check
```

### 2. Read Documentation in Order
```bash
1. cat START_HERE.md              # Quick orientation
2. cat 🧠_REMEMBRANCER_STATUS.md   # Visual dashboard
3. cat REMEMBRANCER_INITIALIZATION.md  # Creation report
4. cat REMEMBRANCER_README.md     # Complete guide
5. cat docs/REMEMBRANCER.md       # The actual memory
```

### 3. Try the CLI
```bash
# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PWD/ops/bin:$PATH"

# Query memory
remembrancer query "monitoring"

# List deployments
remembrancer list deployments

# View timeline
remembrancer timeline

# Verify artifact
remembrancer verify vaultmesh-spawn-elite-v2.2-PRODUCTION.tar.gz
```

### 4. Use Spawn Elite
```bash
# Extract
tar -xzf vaultmesh-spawn-elite-v2.2-PRODUCTION.tar.gz

# Spawn a service
./spawn-elite-complete.sh my-service service

# Test it
cd ~/repos/my-service
make test  # Should pass
```

## 📜 Covenant Principles

The Remembrancer implements three core principles:

### 1. Self-Verifying
```
✅ All artifacts have SHA256 hashes
✅ All hashes recorded in receipts
✅ All receipts verifiable with CLI
✅ All tests pass without manual intervention
```

### 2. Self-Auditing
```
✅ All deployments generate receipts
✅ All decisions recorded as ADRs
✅ All changes leave memory traces
✅ All evidence files preserved
```

### 3. Self-Attesting
```
✅ All memories include verification steps
✅ All receipts contain timestamps
✅ All artifacts cryptographically proven
✅ All queries return contextual evidence
```

Data Flow:
1. User deploys something
2. CLI records deployment → generates receipt
3. Receipt contains SHA256 + timestamp
4. Memory index updated with context
5. Evidence preserved (artifact + docs)
6. System self-verifies via health-check
7. User queries memory for historical context
```
