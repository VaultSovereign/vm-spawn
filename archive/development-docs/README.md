## 🎯 Why These Are Valuable

**The Covenant Journey:**
1. Claimed 10.0/10 without testing (v2.3)
2. **These docs reveal**: Smoke test showed 6.8/10
3. Built properly (v2.4)
4. Achieved true 10.0/10

**These documents prove:**
- We tested honestly
- We admitted failures
- We fixed systematically
- We earned perfection

**The Remembrancer preserves this journey as a lesson:**
- Test before claiming
- Evidence over assertions
- Build it right, not fast
