## 📦 What's Here

These are the **working v2.2 scripts** that were used as extraction sources for v2.4-MODULAR generators.

```
spawn-linux.sh.v2.2           (738 lines)
  └── Embedded ALL generation code
      → Extracted into 9 generators in v2.4

add-elite-features.sh.v2.2    (259 lines)
  └── K8s, CI/CD, monitoring, Docker
      → Extracted into cicd, kubernetes, dockerfile, monitoring generators

spawn-elite-complete.sh.v2.2  (49 lines)
  └── Orchestrator (calls spawn-linux + add-elite)
      → Pattern used in spawn.sh v2.4
```

## ⚠️ DO NOT USE

These scripts are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding v2.4 generator extraction
- Code archaeology
- The Remembrancer's covenant memory

## 🎯 What Happened

**v2.2 Architecture:**
- spawn-linux.sh had 737 lines of embedded generation code

- Rating: 9.5/10

**v2.4 Improvement:**
- Extracted 737 lines → 9 modular generators
- Each generator is independent and testable
- Clean architecture
- Rating: 10.0/10

**These files prove the extraction was faithful.**
