## The Remembrancer's Note

These documents represent the **journey**, not the **destination**. They show:
- How decisions were made
- What problems were solved
- What trade-offs were considered
- What completion looked like

**Truth preserved. History honored. Progress documented.**

ðŸ§  The Remembrancer watches. The archive remembers.
