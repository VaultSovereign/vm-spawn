## 🚀 Deployment Sequence

### Phase 1: Proposal (DAO Vote)
```bash
# 1. Copy snapshot-proposal.md to Snapshot/Tally
# 2. DAO members verify independently:
./ops/bin/health-check
make covenant
remembrancer verify-audit

# 3. Vote passes
```

### Phase 2: Execution (Steward Action)
```bash
# 1. Set operator key
export REMEMBRANCER_KEY_ID=<DAO_GPG_KEY_ID>

# 2. Bootstrap TSA
export REMEMBRANCER_TSA_URL_1="https://freetsa.org/tsr"
export REMEMBRANCER_TSA_CA_CERT_1="https://freetsa.org/files/cacert.pem"
export REMEMBRANCER_TSA_CERT_1="https://freetsa.org/files/tsa.crt"
./ops/bin/tsa-bootstrap

# 3. Seal Genesis
./ops/bin/genesis-seal

# 4. Verify dual-rail
./ops/bin/rfc3161-verify dist/genesis.tar.gz

# 5. Generate receipts index
./ops/bin/receipts-site
```

### Phase 3: First Recording (On-Chain Binding)
```bash
# After proposal executes on-chain:
remembrancer record deploy \
  --component dao-governance \
  --version proposal-001 \
  --sha256 $(sha256sum path/to/artifact | awk '{print $1}') \
  --evidence path/to/artifact \
  --chain_ref "eip155:1/tx:0x<proposal_exec_hash>"

# Sign + timestamp
remembrancer sign path/to/artifact --key $REMEMBRANCER_KEY_ID
remembrancer timestamp path/to/artifact

# Verify and publish
remembrancer verify-full path/to/artifact
./ops/bin/receipts-site

# Commit to main
git add -A
git commit -m "governance: Genesis + proposal-001 recorded"
git push origin main
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### Court-Portable Proofs
Every governance decision includes:
- **GPG signature** (authenticity)
- **Dual RFC 3161 timestamps** (existence from two independent TSAs)
- **Merkle audit receipt** (tamper detection)
- **Chain reference** (on-chain binding)

### Independent Verification
Any DAO member can verify using standard tools:
```bash
gpg --verify <artifact.asc> <artifact>
openssl ts -verify -in <artifact.tsr> -data <artifact> -CAfile <root.ca> -untrusted <tsa.crt>
./ops/bin/remembrancer verify-audit
```

### Standards-Based
- **RFC 3161** (IETF Time-Stamp Protocol) - widely recognized legal standard
- **OpenPGP** (RFC 4880) - sovereign key custody, no CA required
- **JCS** (JSON Canonicalization Scheme) - deterministic serialization
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) - AI/agent interoperability

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Built-In Redundancy
| Component | Primary | Backup | Detection |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| TSA | FreeTSA | Enterprise | Both required |
| Keys | Operator GPG | Revocation certs | Rotation protocol |
| Receipts | Main repo | Merkle audit | Tamper detection |

### Emergency Protocols
- **TSA Outage:** Switch to alternate TSA, annotate receipt
- **Tamper Detection:** Merkle mismatch → deterministic reconciliation
- **Key Compromise:** Revocation receipt → rotate → re-sign

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Proposal Success
- ✅ Snapshot/Tally vote passes
- ✅ Genesis sealed with dual timestamps
- ✅ First proposal recorded with chain ref
- ✅ Receipts index published
- ✅ 3+ members verify independently

### Operational Success
- ✅ All governance recorded with chain refs
- ✅ Merkle root updated on every merge
- ✅ Health checks consistently passing (16/16)
- ✅ Dual-TSA verification on all artifacts
- ✅ No Black Flag incidents

## 🎓 DAO Value Proposition

### Before (Traditional DAO)
- ❌ Governance context in Discord/Forum
- ❌ No cryptographic proof of decisions
- ❌ Can't prove "why" in legal disputes
- ❌ Memory decays over time

### After (VaultMesh Remembrancer)
- ✅ Every decision cryptographically attested
- ✅ Court-portable proof chains
- ✅ Independent verification (no trust required)
- ✅ Memory compounds over time
- ✅ Federation-ready for cross-DAO coordination

### ROI Analysis
**One-Time Cost:**
- Setup time: ~2 hours
- Infrastructure: $0 (FreeTSA free)

**Ongoing Cost:**
- Per-decision: ~5 minutes
- Storage: <1KB per receipt
- TSA: $0-$50/year

**Value Delivered:**
- Legal defensibility: Court-portable proofs
- Transparency: Public, verifiable receipts
- Trust: Cryptographic > verbal commitments
- Future-proof: Standards-based, vendor-portable
