# 🜄 Errata Rite Complete — The Four Scrolls Harmonized

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Commit**: 56ff712  
**Status**: ✅ ALL SCROLLS UNIFIED  

---

## 🎯 Mission

**Objective**: Make ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, START_HERE.md, and AGENTS.md fully consistent with Phase V + Scheduler 10/10 and establish a single source of truth.

**Result**: ✅ **100% HARMONIZED** — All 6 inconsistencies resolved, truth unified across all scrolls.

---

## 📊 Issues Found & Fixed

### **1. Layer 3 Identity Conflict** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**:
- AGENTS.md defined Layer 3 as "DAO Governance Pack"
- ARCHITECTURE.md defined Layer 3 as "Aurora" (distributed coordination)
- Conflicting system diagrams

**Fix**:
- ✅ AGENTS.md now defines Layer 3 as **Aurora**
- ✅ DAO Governance Pack demoted to **optional plugin overlay**
- ✅ System diagram updated to match ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ Dependency flow clarified

**Evidence**:
```
AGENTS.md Line 15:
3. **Aurora** — Distributed coordination (treaty routing, federation, SLOs)
   - The **DAO Governance Pack** is an **optional plugin overlay** (documentation-only), not a separate layer.
```

---

### **2. Test Count Drift** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**:
- README.md header: 26/26 + 7/7 ✅
- README.md System Status: 22/24 ❌
- START_HERE.md: Both 26/26 and 19/19 ❌
- Generator count: 9 vs 11 mismatch

**Fix**:
- ✅ README.md: Removed 22/24, updated to 26/26 + 7/7
- ✅ START_HERE.md: Changed 19/19 → 26/26
- ✅ Generator count: Corrected 9 → 11 files
- ✅ Standardized format: **26/26 core + 7/7 scheduler (100%)**

**Evidence**:
```
README.md Line 162:
- **Tests:** **26/26 core + 7/7 scheduler (100%)**

START_HERE.md Line 43:
# Expected: 26/26 PASSED ✅

START_HERE.md Line 68:
generators/ (11 files)      ⭐ Extracted & tested
```

---

### **3. Phase V Federation Status** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**:
- Some sections used future-tense or "foundations laid"
- Inconsistent completion status

**Fix**:
- ✅ All present-tense, completed status
- ✅ README.md: "✅ COMPLETE (Phase V)"
- ✅ Badges updated: "federation-complete"
- ✅ No future-tense references remain

**Evidence**:
```
README.md Line 160:
- **Federation:** ✅ COMPLETE (Phase V)

README.md Line 17:
- ✅ **Phase V Federation**: Verified complete integration - peer-to-peer anchoring ready
```

---

### **4. Merkle Root Duplication** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**:
- AGENTS.md had hard-coded Merkle root (brittle, can drift)
- No single source of truth
- Multiple copies = maintenance burden

**Fix**:
- ✅ Removed hard-coded root from AGENTS.md
- ✅ Points to canonical source: `docs/REMEMBRANCER.md`
- ✅ Added verification commands
- ✅ Single source of truth established

**Evidence**:
```
AGENTS.md Line 217:
Every memory operation updates a **Merkle root**. The canonical Merkle root is maintained in `docs/REMEMBRANCER.md`.

AGENTS.md Line 749:
**Merkle Root:** See `docs/REMEMBRANCER.md` (canonical source)
```

---

### **5. Aurora KPI Scope Confusion** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**:
- ARCHITECTURE.md header showed 9.2/10 → 9.9/10 (Aurora rollout KPIs)
- Could be confused with overall VaultMesh rating (10.0/10)
- No clarification that these are sub-program specific

**Fix**:
- ✅ Header clarified: "Rating (Aurora sub-program)"
- ✅ Note added: Overall VaultMesh = 10.0/10
- ✅ Prevents reader confusion

**Evidence**:
```
ARCHITECTURE.md Line 6:
**Rating (Aurora sub-program):** 9.2/10 → Target 9.65/10 (Week 1) → 9.9/10 (Week 3)

ARCHITECTURE.md Line 9:
> **Note:** Overall VaultMesh program rating is **10.0/10** (per README.md); this document tracks **Aurora's** cloud rollout KPIs specifically.
```

---

### **6. DAO Pack Layer Positioning** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**:
- DAO Pack was listed as Layer 3 in AGENTS.md
- Actually an optional overlay, not a core layer
- Inconsistent with Aurora being the true Layer 3

**Fix**:
- ✅ DAO Pack repositioned as "optional plugin overlay"
- ✅ Layer 3 = Aurora (distributed coordination)
- ✅ Checklist updated to reflect correct architecture

**Evidence**:
```
AGENTS.md Line 724:
☐ Verify zero coupling (DAO pack is plugin overlay, Aurora is Layer 3)
```

- **AGENTS.md** - The agent architecture reference

All aligned on:
- Layer 3 = Aurora
- Tests = 26/26 + 7/7
- Phase V = Complete
- Merkle root = Canonical source
- Rating = 10.0/10 (overall), Aurora KPIs scoped
