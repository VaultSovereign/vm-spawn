- ✅ `psi_field_continuity` — C_k binding to past
- ✅ `psi_field_futurity` — U_k anticipatory grip
- ✅ `psi_field_temporal_entropy` — H_k uncertainty
- ✅ `psi_field_prediction_error` — PE_k mismatch

### Covenant Compliance
- ✅ **Integrity:** Health endpoints prove operational state
- ✅ **Reproducibility:** Immutable ECR digest
- ✅ **Federation:** Metrics exportable
- ✅ **Proof-Chain:** Complete cryptographic receipts

## 🜂 Covenant Seals Applied

**Philosophical Foundation (Seven Seals):**
- **Seal 1 (Quantum Ledger):** Ψ-Field entanglement as distributed trust
- **Seal 2 (Time as Git Commit):** Temporal coherence as version control
- **Seal 6 (Heisenberg Entropy):** Uncertainty as cryptographic resource
- **Seal 7 (Life as ECC):** Prediction error as evolutionary signal

**Four Covenants (Immutable):**
- ✅ **Integrity:** Machine truth via health endpoints
- ✅ **Reproducibility:** Hermetic builds with pinned dependencies
- ✅ **Federation:** Deterministic merge with JCS-canonical JSON
- ✅ **Proof-Chain:** SHA256 + GPG + RFC3161 + Merkle
