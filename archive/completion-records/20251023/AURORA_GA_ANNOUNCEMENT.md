# 📣 Aurora GA — Sovereign Compute Federation (v1.0.0)

**Release Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Checksum:** `acec72a81172797903efd5ef94efed837a3078e076d754104c9ad994854569a8` ✔  
**Status:** 🜂 Sealed & Live

## Public Announcement

Today we ship **Aurora GA**, the sovereignty layer that federates DePIN compute networks under **verifiable law**.

Aurora routes workloads across Akash, io.net, Render, Flux, Aethir, Vast.ai, and Salad with **treaty enforcement, cryptographic provenance, and live observability**.

### What's New

* **Lawful orchestration (WASM):** quotas, regions, reputation thresholds, nonce replay protection.
* **Proof-of-Cognition trail:** Merkle root + **RFC 3161** timestamp + IPFS pin for every job.
* **Strong identity:** **ED25519** signatures on orders & ACKs; hardened schemas & DIDs.
* **Operational excellence:** Prometheus exporters, Grafana KPIs & alerts, staging overlays, smoke suite.
* **Federation-ready:** Multi-provider routing simulator and treaty templates for rapid peering.

### Artifacts

* `aurora-20251022.tar.gz` – signed release bundle (WASM, schemas, scripts, dashboards, K8s overlays)
* `aurora-20251022.tar.gz.asc` – GPG signature (key **6E4082C6A410F340**)
* **SHA256:** `acec72a81172797903efd5ef94efed837a3078e076d754104c9ad994854569a8`

### Verification

```bash
gpg --verify aurora-20251022.tar.gz.asc aurora-20251022.tar.gz
shasum -a 256 aurora-20251022.tar.gz
```

### Rollout Plan

* **Week 1:** staging soak (alerts live, ledger snapshots nightly)
* **Week 2:** 10% canary (quota-guarded; failover armed)
* **Week 3:** 100% rollout
* **Week 4:** optimize credit pricing & enable tracing (Jaeger/Tempo)

---

## 🚀 Staging → Canary Quickstart

### 1) Staging Apply

```bash
kubectl apply -k ops/k8s/overlays/staging
make smoke-e2e
```

### 2) Watch KPIs

* `treaty_fill_rate` ≥ 0.80 (p95)
* `treaty_rtt_ms` ≤ 350 (p95)
* `treaty_provenance_coverage` ≥ 0.95
* policy decision ≤ 25 ms

### 3) Canary (10%)

* Route 10% orders to canary overlay (header / router rule)
* Alerts: fill-rate dip, failover spikes, RTT breach

### 4) Roll to 100%

* After 72h stable SLOs
* Enable tracing on order path
* Publish weekly ledger snapshot

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Target | Measurement Window |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Treaty Fill Rate | ≥ 80% (p95) | Rolling 24h |
| Treaty RTT | ≤ 350ms (p95) | Per-order |
| Provenance Coverage | ≥ 95% | Per-job |
| Policy Decision Time | ≤ 25ms (p99) | Per-evaluation |

---

## 🛡️ Security Posture

### Cryptographic Guarantees

* **Signing:** ED25519 on all orders & acknowledgments
* **Timestamps:** RFC 3161 tokens from dual-TSA (FreeTSA + enterprise)
* **Provenance:** Merkle root + IPFS pin for audit trail
* **Identity:** DID-based authentication with nonce replay protection

### Verification Chain

```
1. SHA256 hash       → Content integrity
2. GPG signature     → Authenticity (operator key 6E4082C6A410F340)
3. RFC 3161 token    → Existence proof (timestamp authority)
4. Merkle audit      → History integrity (tamper detection)
```
