# VaultMesh Status Markers — Archive Index

Date: 2025-10-23  
Scope: Emoji status marker files archived under `archive/completion-records/`

Purpose
- Preserve the historical, human-friendly status flags without cluttering the repo root.
- Make the ritual queryable: a single place to scan status markers chronologically.

How This Index Is Organized
- Each dated folder under `archive/completion-records/` groups a batch of markers archived together.
- Filenames include an emoji and a short title; they are preserved verbatim.

Latest Batch: 2025-10-23

Quick Queries
- List all archived marker files:
  - `rg -n "archive/completion-records/.+\.txt$" -S`
- List the most recent batch (by folder name sort):
  - `ls -1d archive/completion-records/*/ | sort | tail -1 | xargs -I{} ls -1 {}`
- Search for a specific phase across all markers:
  - `rg -n "PHASE|DEPLOY|FOUNDATION|DOCUMENTATION" archive/completion-records -S`

Notes
- The content of each marker file is preserved exactly as originally written.
- If new markers are added to the repo root in the future, archive them into a new dated folder and append a section here.
- For machine-verifiable history, consider recording each marker as a Remembrancer event receipt (component: `status-marker`).
