# Cleanup Log – 2025-10-24

| Change | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Created `STATUS.md` | Single source of truth for service readiness; supersedes previous decks. |
| Removed redundant status docs | Deleted `ANALYSIS_INDEX.md`, `EXPLORATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `SERVICES_DEEP_DIVE.md`, `AUDIT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (others already retired). |
| Updated service READMEs | Scheduler (tests note), Ψ-Field (reframed as stability metric), Aurora Router (explicit mock status), Analytics (Phase 5 pending). |

Future cleanup should append to this file to keep track of repository hygiene tasks.
