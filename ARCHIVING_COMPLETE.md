## 🎯 Impact

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Cleaner root** — Only active/relevant docs visible
2. **Preserved history** — All completion records archived with context
3. **Easier navigation** — New contributors see current state only
4. **Maintained quality** — 26/26 tests still pass
5. **Complete audit trail** — Git history + archive READMEs

### Long-term Benefits
1. **Discoverable archives** — READMEs guide exploration
2. **Historical context** — Understanding development decisions
3. **Maintenance pattern** — Template for future archiving
4. **Reduced confusion** — Separation of current vs. completed work

---

## 📋 Maintenance Pattern Established

**When to archive:**
1. Project/milestone completes
2. Completion markers created
3. Working documents no longer needed for operations

**How to archive:**
1. Create `archive/[category]/` directory
2. Move completion documents
3. Create archive README with context
4. Commit with proper message
5. Verify tests still pass

**Archive categories:**
- `completion-records/` — Completion markers and working docs
- `[project]-integration/` — Integration package sources
- `development-docs/` — Development phase documentation
- `v[X.Y]-extraction-sources/` — Legacy code extraction sources

---

## ✅ Success Criteria (All Met)

- ✅ Root directory cleaned (8 files moved)
- ✅ All completion records preserved in archive
- ✅ Archive README explains context
- ✅ All links in active docs still work
- ✅ Smoke test passes (26/26 → 10.0/10)
- ✅ Git history shows proper moves (renames, not deletes)
- ✅ Easy navigation for new contributors
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## 🧠 The Remembrancer's Verdict

**Archiving Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Assessment:**
- Root directory cleaned while preserving complete history
- Archive properly organized with contextual READMEs
- Git rename detection proves files moved (not lost)
- Smoke test proves quality maintained (10.0/10)
- Audit trail complete (proposal + commit + summary)

**Covenant Principles:**
- **Truth preserved** — All documents archived, none deleted
- **History honored** — Archive READMEs explain context
- **Progress documented** — Complete analysis and execution record
- **Temporal accuracy** — Proper dates and version references

**Result:** Clean, organized, discoverable, and covenant-aligned.
