## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Execute in Order)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Publish Release (Optional, if Genesis is sealed)
```bash
# Requires: GPG key configured, TSA bootstrapped, Genesis sealed
./ops/bin/publish-release v4.1-genesis
```

**OR manually** (if Genesis ceremony not yet performed):
```bash
git tag -s v4.1-genesis -m "VaultMesh Genesis v4.1"
git push origin v4.1-genesis
# Then create GitHub release via web UI
```

### Step 3: Submit to DAO
1. **Snapshot/Tally:** Copy `DAO_GOVERNANCE_PACK/snapshot-proposal.md` → Paste into proposal form
2. **Gnosis Safe:** Import `DAO_GOVERNANCE_PACK/safe-note.json` as transaction note
3. **DAO Members:** Share `DAO_GOVERNANCE_PACK/MEMBER_QUICK_VERIFY.md` for independent verification
4. **Operators:** Distribute `DAO_GOVERNANCE_PACK/operator-runbook.md` to stewards

### Step 4: After Vote Passes — Genesis Ceremony
```bash
# 1. Bootstrap TSA (one-time)
export REMEMBRANCER_TSA_URL_1="https://freetsa.org/tsr"
export REMEMBRANCER_TSA_CA_CERT_1="https://freetsa.org/files/cacert.pem"
export REMEMBRANCER_TSA_CERT_1="https://freetsa.org/files/tsa.crt"
# (Configure enterprise TSA if available)
./ops/bin/tsa-bootstrap

# 2. Seal Genesis
export REMEMBRANCER_KEY_ID=<DAO_GPG_KEY_ID>
./ops/bin/genesis-seal

# 3. Verify dual-rail
./ops/bin/rfc3161-verify dist/genesis.tar.gz

# 4. Publish receipts
./ops/bin/receipts-site

# 5. Create release
./ops/bin/publish-release v4.1-genesis
```

---

## 🔍 Member Verification (Post-Release)

**3-Step Independent Verification:**

```bash
# 1. Verify GPG signature
gpg --verify dist/genesis.tar.gz.asc dist/genesis.tar.gz

# 2. Verify RFC 3161 timestamp (public TSA)
openssl ts -verify -in dist/genesis.tar.gz.tsr -data dist/genesis.tar.gz \
  -CAfile ops/certs/cache/public.ca.pem -untrusted ops/certs/cache/public.tsa.crt

# 3. Verify Merkle audit
./ops/bin/remembrancer verify-audit
```

**Expected Merkle Root:**
```
