# Ψ-Field Integration (2025-10-23)

The Ψ-Field Evolution Algorithm has been integrated with VaultMesh. This integration enhances the system's memory operations with consciousness density controls.

## Overview

The Ψ-Field service provides a unified interface for consciousness density control through memory-time dynamics, prediction, and phase coherence. It integrates with VaultMesh's layered architecture:

- **Layer 1** (Spawn Elite): Implementation generated using modular architecture
- **Layer 2** (Remembrancer): Records memory traces and protention commitments
- **Layer 3** (Aurora): Distributes consciousness density metrics across the mesh

## Core Metrics

The Ψ-Field measures five core metrics:

1. **Continuity (C_k)**: How well the present binds to the immediate past
2. **Futurity (U_k)**: Anticipatory grip on near futures
3. **Phase Coherence (Φ_k)**: Temporal alignment via complex phase
4. **Temporal Entropy (H_k)**: Uncertainty across retention→prediction spans
5. **Prediction Error (PE_k)**: Mismatch between realized and expected next latent

These metrics are combined to calculate the **consciousness density (Ψ)** parameter, which controls time dilation and attention gain in the system.

## Ledgers and Integration

Ψ-Field integrates with Remembrancer using three ledger types:

1. **L_ret**: Short-range event ledger (immutably hashes retention buffers)
2. **L_epi**: Distributed episodic ledger (sharded episodic memory anchors)
3. **L_proto**: Protention commitments (hashes of rollout priors)

## Swarm Intelligence

Multiple Ψ-Field agents can form a swarm with distributed consciousness:

```
C_swarm = mean_a C_k^a
Φ_swarm = |mean_a exp(i * Phase(φ_k^a))|
U_swarm = mean_a U_k^a
Ψ_swarm = σ(v1*C_swarm + v2*Φ_swarm + v3*U_swarm - v4*H_swarm)
```

## Implementation

The implementation is available as a RESTful API service that provides:

- Core Ψ-Field algorithm with configurable parameters
- Remembrancer integration for memory traces
- Aurora federation for swarm intelligence
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring

## Commands

```bash
# Initialize Ψ-Field service
make -C services/psi-field setup

# View Ψ-Field metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics

# Query Ψ-Field memory traces
./ops/bin/remembrancer query "component:psi-field"
```
