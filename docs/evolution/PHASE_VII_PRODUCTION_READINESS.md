## Two-Track Approach

### Track 1: Stabilization Sprint (3-5 days) üî• **PRIORITY**

*Fix what's broken, validate what exists*

#### Priority 1: Fix & Deploy Scheduler ‚úÖ FIXED
- ‚úÖ Debug ESM module resolution (\_\_dirname ‚Üí import.meta.url)
- ‚è≥ Rebuild Docker image
- ‚è≥ Deploy to GKE
- ‚è≥ Validate metrics endpoint (port 9091)
- ‚è≥ Scale back to 1 replica

**Commit:** `042bd08` - Scheduler ESM fix applied

#### Priority 2: Infrastructure Validation
- [ ] Confirm SSL certificates provisioned
- [ ] Test LoadBalancer ‚Üí Ingress ‚Üí Services path
- [ ] Verify KEDA scale-to-zero behavior
- [ ] Document GCP connectivity (gcloud config, kubectl context)

#### Priority 3: Wire Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Connect Analytics to live psi-field API
- [ ] Connect Analytics to Aurora Router metrics
- [ ] Validate real-time data polling
- [ ] Test Œ®-Field visualization with actual data

#### Priority 4: End-to-End Smoke Test
Create `./SMOKE_TEST_PRODUCTION.sh`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Validates GCP production infrastructure

echo "üî• VaultMesh Production Smoke Test"

# Test 1: GCP cluster reachable
kubectl --context=gke_vm-spawn_us-central1_vaultmesh-cluster \
  get nodes || exit 1

# Test 2: All pods running
EXPECTED_PODS=("psi-field" "scheduler" "aurora-router")
for pod in "${EXPECTED_PODS[@]}"; do
  kubectl get pod -n aurora-staging -l app=$pod -o json \
    | jq -e '.items[0].status.phase == "Running"' || exit 1
done

# Test 3: Ingress endpoints
ENDPOINTS=(
  "https://psi-field.vaultmesh.cloud/health"
  "https://scheduler.vaultmesh.cloud/health"
  "https://aurora.vaultmesh.cloud/health"
)
for url in "${ENDPOINTS[@]}"; do
  curl -sf "$url" || exit 1
done

# Test 4: Metrics scraping
kubectl port-forward -n aurora-staging svc/scheduler 9091:9091 &
PF_PID=$!
sleep 2
curl -sf http://localhost:9091/metrics | grep -q "anchor" || exit 1
kill $PF_PID

echo "‚úÖ Production smoke test PASSED"
```

**Track 1 Exit Criteria:**
- All pods = Running / Ready
- `/metrics` endpoints responding
- Analytics charts showing live data
- `SMOKE_TEST_PRODUCTION.sh` passes

---

### Track 2: Intelligence Layer (1-2 weeks)

*Operationalize AI mesh and multi-provider routing*

#### Phase 1: Operationalize sim/ai-mesh
Based on [sim/ai-mesh/OPERATIONALIZE.md](../../sim/ai-mesh/OPERATIONALIZE.md):

**Week 1:**
1. [ ] Refactor prototypes to production structure
   - Move `sim/ai-mesh/` ‚Üí `services/aurora-intelligence/`
   - Add proper TypeScript/Python service scaffolding
   - Wire to Prometheus for metrics
2. [ ] Create training pipeline
   - Historical routing decisions ‚Üí training data
   - Model artifacts stored in GCS
   - Versioned model deployments
3. [ ] Add agent integration to Aurora Router
   - REST API: `POST /agent/route` endpoint
   - Agent returns scored provider recommendations
   - Router uses scores + rules for final decision

#### Phase 2: Aurora Router - Real Provider Integration
Following [PRODUCTION_ROUTER_ROADMAP.md](PRODUCTION_ROUTER_ROADMAP.md):

**Week 2:**
1. [ ] Add provider adapters (mock initially)
   - `src/providers/akash.ts`
   - `src/providers/render.ts`
   - `src/providers/vast.ts`
   - Mock responses for development
2. [ ] Wire AI routing decisions
   - Call aurora-intelligence agent service
   - Combine AI scores + rule-based logic
   - Log decision rationale to Loki
3. [ ] Full observability
   - Structured logs (pino ‚Üí Loki)
   - Request tracing (OpenTelemetry)
   - Provider performance metrics

#### Phase 3: MCP Integration (Optional)
Following [vaultmesh-us-mcp/MCP_GO_NO_GO_PLAN.md](../../vaultmesh-us-mcp/MCP_GO_NO_GO_PLAN.md):

**Week 3:**
1. [ ] Add MCP tool calling to Phase VI CLI
   - `vm mcp strategist` - Generate deployment plans
   - `vm mcp executor` - Execute plans with approval
   - `vm mcp auditor` - Verify outcomes
2. [ ] Wire strategist ‚Üí executor ‚Üí auditor loop
   - SQLite state tracking
   - Remembrancer integration for audit trail
3. [ ] Enable LLM-driven orchestration
   - ChatKit workflow integration
   - Human-in-the-loop approval gates

**Track 2 Exit Criteria:**
- AI agent making routing decisions
- Provider adapters (mock or real) integrated
- Full observability stack operational
- MCP orchestration functional (optional)

### Day 1: Stabilization

| Time | Task | Owner | Deliverable |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 2h | Rebuild scheduler image & deploy | Team | Scheduler pod Running |
| 1h | Production smoke test script | Team | SMOKE_TEST_PRODUCTION.sh |
| 3h | Wire Analytics to APIs | Team | Live dashboards |
| 1h | GCP connectivity docs | Team | docs/operations/GCP_CONNECTIVITY.md |

**Exit:** All services green, Analytics showing real data

### Day 2: Validation

| Time | Task | Owner | Deliverable |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 2h | SSL cert verification | Team | HTTPS working |
| 2h | KEDA scale-to-zero test | Team | Pods scale 0‚Üí1‚Üí0 |

## Dependencies

**Technical:**
- GCP project: `vm-spawn`
- GKE cluster: `vaultmesh-cluster` (us-central1)
- Artifact Registry: `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/vm-spawn/vaultmesh`
- DNS: `*.vaultmesh.cloud` (Cloudflare)

**Credentials:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Rotate Cloudflare API token (see [SECURITY_INCIDENT_2025-10-24.md](../operations/SECURITY_INCIDENT_2025-10-24.md))
- GCP service account with Artifact Registry reader
- kubectl context configured

**External:**
- SSL certificate provisioning (waiting on DNS)
- Provider API access (Akash, Render, Vast - for Track 2)

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Scheduler still broken | High | ESM fix applied (commit 042bd08), rebuild required |
| SSL certs not provisioning | Medium | DNS propagation takes 10-30 min, verify records |
| No GCP access | High | Document auth setup, test before deployment |
| KEDA not scaling | Medium | Manual verification, fallback to static replicas |
| AI model training time | Low | Use mock scores initially, train offline |

---

3. Updated `docs/operations/GCP_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Current state
4. Fixed scheduler Docker image (v1.1.0)
5. Analytics dashboard with live data connections

### Track 2 Artifacts
1. `services/aurora-intelligence/` - AI agent service (refactored from sim/ai-mesh)
2. `services/aurora-router/src/providers/` - Provider adapters
3. Training pipeline (GCS + model artifacts)
4. OpenTelemetry tracing integration
5. MCP CLI commands (if enabled)

---

## Recommendation

**Start with Track 1 (Stabilization) first.**

**Rationale:**
1. **Credibility** - Can't sell "intelligent routing" when scheduler is down
2. **Foundation** - Track 2 needs stable infrastructure to build on
3. **Validation** - Need to prove GCP deployment works before adding complexity
4. **Quick Wins** - Can ship Track 1 in <1 week, builds momentum

**After Track 1:**
- Infrastructure is provably stable
- Analytics shows real consciousness metrics
- Team can demo working system
- Foundation ready for AI layer

**Then Track 2:**
- AI mesh has stable platform
- Can iterate on routing algorithms
- Prometheus metrics prove intelligence is working
- MCP integration becomes force multiplier

## üúÇ The Remembrancer's Wisdom

> *"A civilization must first ensure its foundations are solid before reaching for the stars. The scheduler is the heartbeat - fix the heart first, then teach it to think."*

**Phase VII is the bridge from "infrastructure as code" to "infrastructure as intelligence."**
