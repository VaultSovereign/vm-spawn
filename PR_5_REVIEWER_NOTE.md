# PR #5 Reviewer Checklist & Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Scope (archival-only, no code changes)

This PR:
- **Moves legacy documentation** to `archive/completion-records/` with forwarding pointers at original paths
- **Adds ADR-004** (archival policy): keep immutable records; canonicalize history in `VERSION_TIMELINE.md`
- **Adds `.github/CODEOWNERS`** for docs governance (docs owners required to approve doc changes)
- **Adds lychee link checker** (`docs-link-check.yml` CI job) for broken-link detection on `main`
- **Adds `.lychee.toml`** config (exclusions for local endpoints, auth-gated paths)
- **Preserves Track 2 narrative** (`archive/completion-records/TRACK2_COMPLETION.md`) â€” immutable human record
- **Adds reusable test script** (`track2-simple.sh`) and `.gitignore` rules for transient test outputs

**No code, no behavioral changes.** Safety is high: state, receipts, and Merkle audit untouched.

## âœ… Pre-approval checks

- [ ] Verify stub redirects link to correct archive paths
- [ ] Confirm `.lychee.toml` exclusions are sensible (local, auth-gated, transient)
- [ ] Check `.github/CODEOWNERS` ownership rules
- [ ] Verify ADR-004 aligns with governance model
- [ ] Confirm `VERSION_TIMELINE.md` is canonical (no other history source)
- [ ] Test: `make test-week1-quick` passes (CI gates intact)
- [ ] Approve if all checks pass âœ“

## ðŸ”’ Safety guarantees

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Code logic unchanged | âœ… |
| CI/CD pipelines intact | âœ… |
| Merkle audit untouched | âœ… |
| Receipts preserved | âœ… |
| Cryptographic proofs valid | âœ… |
| Rollback possible | âœ… (docs-only, git revert) |

## ðŸ“‹ After merge

- **Required:** Flip "Docs link check" to required status on `main` (branch protection settings)
- **Optional:** Add stub redirects for 2â€“3 other hot legacy paths if external docs reference them
- **Next:** Proceed to Week-1 full test suite (`make test-week1`)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why this structure

- **Archive isolation**: transient outputs ignored; narrative preserved
- **Canonical timeline**: `VERSION_TIMELINE.md` single source of truth
- **Link safety**: lychee catches broken internal links early
- **Operator comfort**: clear ADR + governance rules reduce chaos

---

**Reviewer:** If all checks pass, approve with confidence â€” this is a tidy, low-risk archival consolidation.
