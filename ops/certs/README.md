Place TSA trust anchors here for RFC 3161 verification.

## FreeTSA CA

### Verification

Verify timestamps with:

```bash
openssl ts -verify -data file -in file.tsr -CAfile ops/certs/freetsa-ca.pem
```

### Obtaining the CA Certificate

1. Visit [freetsa.org](https://www.freetsa.org/index_en.php)
2. Download their CA certificate (self-signed)
3. Save as `ops/certs/freetsa-ca.pem`

FreeTSA example usage and verification guidance is provided on their site.

## Notes
